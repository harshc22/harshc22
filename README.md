# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Harsh, a recent Software Engineering graduate from McMaster University, currently looking for a full-time software developer role.

I’ve interned at **Ford** and **PAL Aerospace**, where I worked on backend systems, automation tools, and DevOps pipelines using technologies like **Python, Go, Ansible, and Docker**. Most recently, I’ve worked on AI validation at **Data Annotation Tech**, combining my Python skills with a focus on model accuracy and reliability.

I'm passionate about building **reliable, scalable, and thoughtful software**, whether it's backend infrastructure, automation scripts, or end-to-end systems.

Let’s connect and build something awesome together!
